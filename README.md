# UDPipe 2

This is the UDPipe 2.

Compared to UDPipe 1:
- UDPipe 2 is Python-only,
- UDPipe 2 is meant as a research tool, not as a user-friendly UDPipe 1 replacement,
- UDPipe 2 is tested only in Linux,
- UDPipe 2 achieves much better performance, but requires a GPU for reasonable
  performance.

UDPipe 2 is available as a REST service running at https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe .
If you like, you can use `udpipe2_client.py` to interact with it.

However, if you prefer to run UDPipe 2 locally, you have come to the right place ðŸ˜€

## Remaining of the documentation to be finished soon.
