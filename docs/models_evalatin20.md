## EvaLatin 2020 Models #evalatin20_models

EvaLatin 2020 Models are distributed under the
[CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence.
The models are based solely on [EvaLatin 2020](https://github.com/CIRCSE/LT4HALA)
treebanks, and additionally use [multilingual BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md).

The models require [UDPipe 2](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/2).

### Acknowledgements #evalatin20_models_acknowledgements

This work was supported by the grant no. GX20-16819X of the Grant Agency of the
Czech Republic, and has been using language resources stored and distributed by
the LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ project of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of
the Czech Republic (project LM2018101).

The models were trained on [EvaLatin 2020](https://github.com/CIRCSE/LT4HALA) treebanks.

Finally, [multilingual BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md)
is used to provide contextualized word embeddings.
